# 📅 `gcal`

Manage `Google Calendar` events from your `Elixir` / `Phoenix` App.

</div>

# Why? 🤷‍♀️

After building our 
[`calendar`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar) 
prototype
that allowed us to visualize 
our `Google Calendar` events
in a more friendly interface,
we realized that much of the `code`
could be reused.
So we decided to split the code
out into an independently tested package
that _anyone_ can use. 

# What? 🗓️

A _tiny_ well-documented, tested & maintained `Elixir` library 
for interacting with `Google Calendar`.

# Who?

`gcal` is _by_ us _for_ us (`@dwyl`).
We are _using_ it in our 
[`calendar`](https://github.com/dwyl/calendar) 
and 
[`MVP`](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp).
Anyone `else` that needs to interact with `Google Calendar`
from their `Elixir` / `Phoenix` App(s)
is very welcome to use it.
